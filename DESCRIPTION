Description: This package combines trait data and a phylogenetic tree (or trees) into a 
    single object of class treedata.table. The resulting object can be easily 
    manipulated to simultaneously change the trait- and tree-level sampling.
    Currently implemented functions allow users to use a data.table syntax when
    performing operations on the trait dataset within the treedata.table object.
